    <h1>The Practioner</h1>
    <p>
      Thomas graduated from Middlesex University with a First Class BSc (hons) in

  Traditional Chinese Medicine and also received an award from the ATCM (Association

  of Traditional Chinese Medicine) for excellence in TCM studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      His practice focuses on the core concepts of Traditional Chinese Medicine including

  ‘Bian Zheng Lun Zhi’ (treatment according to syndrome differentiation) based on TCM

  theory such as the Zang Fu, Fundamental Substances including Qi and Blood, Yin Yang

  and the Five Elements. This is traditionally ascertained through four examinations,

  inquiry, observation and palpation as well as osculation and olfaction. After a diagnosis

  is made, treatment is undertaken to readjust and harmonise the body so that healing

  can take place.
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of his degree he was also required to have a solid grounding in anatomy and

  physiology, western pathology and western medical diagnostics and as such,

  incorporates them into his practice to ensure the upmost care and safety of his patients.

      Thomas is a kind, caring and empathetic practitioner who is passionate about his

  patient’s health and wellbeing and began his foray into the Chinese healing arts when

  learning Qi Gong that coincided with training in a style of Shaolin Gong Fu that he began

  learning at the age of 14.

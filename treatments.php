    <h2>Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Origin of Disease</h2>
    <p>
      Chinese Medicine has been practiced for thousands of years and is built on the

understanding that the body is not separate from the mind and is in fact, an integrated

unit. Our emotions can have a direct relationship on our physical health and our

physical health can directly influence our mental and emotional capacity and wellbeing.
    </p>
    <p>
    As the universal concept of Yin and Yang is central to its practice, balance is sought to be

restored within the individual through its various modalities, as life's rhythms and

environments can cause detriment to our health if not in synchronicity with our daily

patterns and constitutions.
    </p>
    <h2>Acupuncture</h2>
    <p>
    Acupuncture involves the insertion of fine needles into specific areas of the body known

as Acupuncture points, lying on various channels of Qi that the ancient Chinese

conceived of running throughout the body. Any blockage of this energy can manifest in

pain and disease and as such the systematic needling of these points seeks to readjust

and harmonise the body to allow the free flow of Qi, release of pain and the return to a

state of equilibrium.
